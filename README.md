Yes.

Time will teach you.

I met a girl. She became my friend. Then my lover. Then my best friend and my lover. I thought we would marry one day.
Now we don't speak anymore
I know a boy. We played in school. We were inseparable. As brothers. Time passed. We changed.
Now we don't speak anymore
I met a man. We traveled together. 6 weeks. 18-24 hours a day, 7 days a week we spent together. He knows my darkest secrets. Our travels finished
Now we don't speak anymore
I had a friend. We lived together for 2 years. We used to laugh a lot. We left university. We had the best of intentions to keep close. Life got in the way
Now we barely speak anymore
I met a boy. We don't speak so often. Not every day, sometimes not even every week. Time will pass and we will drift, apart then together, apart than together; caught in an eternal drift.

He knew the girl that was my lover
He knew the boy who was my play mate
He knew the man I traveled with
He knew the friend I lived with
He's seen them come. He's seen them go. He'll see them come, he'll see them go.

That boy is my brother

Time and life has shown me - he'll be by my side forever. Because he's my brother
